  <h1>The Beloved</h1>
  <h3>Women’s lives today are hectic with demands coming from all directions.
    Our culture can be discouraging and overwhelming. Social media serves as a constant
    reminder of all the ways we fall short of perfection. Jesus says in John 10:10,
    “The thief comes only to steal, kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life,
    and have it to the full.” How do we live that full, abundant life that Jesus came to give us?
    Join us as we look into the book of Colossians for God’s timeless truth, wisdom and inspiration
    to live the life God desires for us.</h3>

  <h1>A Little History</h1>
    <h4>More than twenty-five years ago, godly women of vision in the Dubuque area established an annual
      conference designed to encourage and challenge women through God-honoring, Bible-focused ministry along
      with inspiring music and great fellowship.  Emmaus Bible College is honored to continue this legacy,
      serving new generations of women who love God’s Word and thirst to know it more.</h3>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h4>Women in the Word Ministries claims Luke 8:15 as its theme verse. In the Parable of the Sower,
      Christ himself explains that those who receive the seed in good soil “are the ones who, hearing the word,
      hold it fast in an honest and good heart, and bear fruit with patience” (Luke 8:15, ESV). Our objectives
      for the conference are:</h4>
